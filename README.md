This is my repository for capturing 433.95Mhz RF remotes and replaying them. This
Requires a Raspberry Pi with an RF Receiver connected to pin 23 and a transmitter
connected to pin 24. Once codes are captured the RF Receiver is no longer
necessary (obviously).

Most of this code was adapted from [george7378's instructable guide](http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-Raspberry-Pi-433MHz-Home-Automation/).
I mostly modified send\_rf.py (so far).
